# Niranjan Kulkarni - About Me Page
Experienced supply chain and operations strategist with a deep focus on cold chain logistics, food safety systems, and retail execution for high-sensitivity categories like dairy, meat, and bakery. I bridge the gap between ground operations and digital transformation by integrating demand forecasting tools, ISO 22000:2018 systems, and data-driven decision support into everyday execution.

With a track record in regulatory compliance (FSSAI, FSSC 22000, World Bank/ADB/JICA-funded infrastructure projects) and deep hands-on experience in vendor management, client reviews, and cost optimization, I thrive at the intersection of process excellence and stakeholder alignment.

I’ve worked on:
	•	Implementing ISO/FSSC-aligned audit, traceability, and complaint dashboards for chilled operations
	•	Evaluating and deploying demand planning tools (Oracle RDF, Reflexis, Relex) for retail scenarios
	•	Designing space–cost–ROI models to address underutilized cold chain capacity
	•	Leading Monthly & Quarterly Business Reviews, escalation handling, and contract closure

Passionate about building systems that scale and mentoring teams to take ownership across functions — from procurement to food safety to analytics.
